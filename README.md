# YouFastEnough_Godot
YouFastEnough_PyGame code built on a Game Engine: Godot Game Engine; added more 'quirks' to the improved version of the game

- Realized could combine **love for programming and gaming: discovered interest within Game Development**
- decided to **replicate my ENCMP 100 Programming Competition submission** within the **Godot Game Engine**. 
- Game designed **using only User-Interface (UI) design tools**
- **Implemented a few more (minor) ideas** (Hint Timer, Hint Deduction multipliers, on-screen cues and others)
- **Continued Development**: had ideas to implement leaderboards and make music and include art. 
- Project **crashed ‘scenes’ (files) twice from my error**, thus it **forced me to become familiar with the GitHub desktop/website**; this minor skill being used in future Godot work.

Project **demonstrated my ability to transfer key game ideas and game design** from the original design within the Spyder IDE and the Pygame module. Additionally, it served as one of the **key projects that familiarized me with Godot, game dev. concepts and some other Godot Engine features**, like timers - the hardest of them all for me.
